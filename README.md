# Newtons Method
Group project for Object Oriented Programming with Applications course taken at the University of Edinburgh for MSc in Computational Applied Mathematics.

The C# program uses Newton's method to establish a relationship between y_t (population in millions) and t (periods of time) in the population of the UK (in millions) between 1955 and 2015 csv. The program tests out three different models:
1. ```math
y_t = x_1 e^{x_2 t}
```
2. 
3.
