# Newtons Method
Group project for Object Oriented Programming with Applications course taken at the University of Edinburgh for MSc in Computational Applied Mathematics.

The C# program uses Newton's method to establish a relationship between y_t (population in millions) and t (periods of time) in the population of the UK (in millions) between 1955 and 2015 csv. The program tests out three different models:
1. ![y_t = x_1 e^{x_2 t}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%3D%5Cfrac%7B-b%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bb%5E2-4ac%7D%7D%7B2a%7D)
