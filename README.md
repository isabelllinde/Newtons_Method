# Newtons Method
Group project for Object Oriented Programming with Applications course taken at the University of Edinburgh for MSc in Computational Applied Mathematics.

The C# program uses Newton's method to establish a relationship between y<sub>t</sub> (population in millions) and t (periods of time) in the population of the UK (in millions) between 1955 and 2015 csv. The program tests out three different models:
1. y<sub>t</sub> = x<sub>1</sub>e<sup>x<sub>2</sub>t</sup>
2. y<sub>t</sub> = x<sub>1</sub>&frac(1+x<sub>2</sub>e<sup>x<sub>3</sub>t</sup>)
3. y<sub>t</sub> = x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>t + x<sub>3</sub>t<sup>2</sup> + x<sub>4</sub>t<sup>3</sup>
